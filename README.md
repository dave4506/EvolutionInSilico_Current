## Course Information
### Description
*While every population of living organisms is evolving, not everything that evolves is alive. Natureâ€™s success at finding innovative solutions to complex problems has inspired many computational implementations of the evolutionary process. Philosophically, this is possible because evolution is itself a substrate neutral process (i.e., evolution can occur regardless of what particular substance makes up the individuals in a population). This fundamental property of evolution creates a deep connection between computational implementations and the biological process responsible for the diversity of life on Earth. We will highlight this connection and the possibility of two-way interdisciplinary discovery through regular readings and discussions. Some of the various implementations of evolution we will learn about include approaches to solve optimization problems, building controllers and/or bodies for robots, and using computational instances of Darwinian evolution to study fundamental questions in biology.* 

### Objectives
- You will develop a deep understanding of the evolutionary process; both how it can be harnessed to solve "real-world" problems, and how it can be digitized to study biological questions. 

- You will engage often with primary literature, developing the necessary background to evaluate and hopefully contribute to active research on Evolution *In Silico*.

- You will extend or create a computational implementation of evolution as part of your group projects, which could lead to publication in one of several appropriate conference proceedings or journals. 

### Prerequisites
There will be a non-trivial amount of biological concepts discussed in this course. It is not required that you have a formal background, but a comfort or curiosity about ecological and evolutionary processes will be very helpful. 

In addition to Math 115, some comfort with basic probability or statistics will be useful. 

Since we will be using, extending, and creating computational models of evolution as a core part of this class, you should be comfortable programing in at least one commonly used "scripting" language such as Python, R, or Matlab.

**Feel free to chat with me about your programing skill level or other concerns about the prerequisites if you have any concerns.**  

### Assesment
- 40% Group Homework Assignments
- 30% Group Term Project and Presentation
- 20% Literature Summaries
- 10% Participation

We will approach topics about Evolution *In Silico* from primary literature readings and discussions. My lectures will primarily reinforce core concepts and develop the necessary background to make those readings accessible. Group homework assignments will introduce you to different implementations and uses of evolution in computation. You will also work on a larger group project that extends (or creates) an implementation of Evolution *In Silico* to address scientific questions of the group's choice.
